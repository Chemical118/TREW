// Make one pass through a zlib, gzip, or raw deflate compressed stream and
// build an index, with access points about every span bytes of uncompressed
// output. gzip files with multiple members are fully indexed. span should be
// chosen to balance the speed of random access against the memory requirements
// of the list, which is about 32K bytes per access point. The return value is
// the number of access points on success (>= 1), Z_MEM_ERROR for out of
// memory, Z_BUF_ERROR for a premature end of input, Z_DATA_ERROR for a format
// or verification error in the input file, or Z_ERRNO for a file read error.
// On success, *built points to the resulting index, otherwise it's NULL.
// int deflate_index_build(FILE *fp, off_t span, struct deflate_index **built);

// Use the index to read len bytes from offset into buf. Return the number of
// bytes read or a negative error code. If data is requested past the end of
// the uncompressed data, then deflate_index_extract() will return a value less
// than len, indicating how much was actually read into buf. If given a valid
// index, this function should not return an error unless the file was modified
// somehow since the index was generated, given that deflate_index_build() had
// validated all of the input. If nevertheless there is a failure, Z_BUF_ERROR
// is returned if the compressed data ends prematurely, Z_DATA_ERROR if the
// deflate compressed data is not valid, Z_MEM_ERROR if out of memory,
// Z_STREAM_ERROR if the index is not valid, or Z_ERRNO if there is an error
// reading or seeking on the input file.
